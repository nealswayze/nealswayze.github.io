## Education
- B.S in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability from Colorado State Unviersity - 2018
- M.S in Forest Science from Colorado State University - 2020

## Work Experience

#### Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) 
  - Flight planning and airspace clearance
  - High accuracy ground control planning and collection
  - Multitemporal RGB and Multispectral image collection
  - Photogrammetry processing (Agisoft Metashape, RealityCapture)
  - Structure from Motion Point Cloud Processing (ground classification, filtering, rasterization)
  - Point Cloud Segmentation (individual tree height, crown area, and dBH detection)
  - Stand Level Forest Structure Characterization (tree count estimates, basal area, above ground biomass)

#### Satellite Remote Sensing Data
  - NASA-GEDI Waveform Spaceborne LiDAR
  - NASA-ICESat-2 Photon Spaceborn LiDAR
  - NASA-Landsat Time Series Generation
  - NASA SRTM Topography Metrics
  - Sentinel-1 C-Band Synthetic Apperature Radar
