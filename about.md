I am an emerging researcher in natural resource monitoring focused on the applications of LiDAR (aerial and spaceborne) as well as UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) for modeling and monitoring natural resources. I am passionate about improving and advancing the methods that scientists and land managers use for monitoring the natural world.
