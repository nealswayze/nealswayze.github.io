Dr. Jody Vogeler is a spatial ecologist with wide ranging research interests including forest disturbance dynamics, wildlife habitat ecology, assessing resistance and resilience within various ecosystems, and translating research results into management relevant information.

The Vogeler Research Lab specialize in integrating remote sensing data sets with field surveys and other reference data to better understand forest disturbance dynamics and wildlife-habitat relationships at multiple spatial and temporal scales, monitor various impacts of land cover and land use change (LCLUC), as well as investigating additional ecological questions within a diverse range of vegetation communities.

Dr. Vogeler and her lab group have extensive experience processing a variety of remote sensing data, conducting geospatial analyses, and relaying strengths and limitations of spatial products to the management community across multiple national and international regions and ecosystems. The Vogeler Research Lab is currently working on several projects across the US integrating Landsat time series along with data from other satellite and airborne remote sensing sources (e.g. airborne LiDAR, GEDI, ICESat-2, SAR, VHR imagery, Sentinel-2) for characterizing forest attributes and disturbance regimes, monitoring of forest health and functioning, quantifying regional carbon dynamics, assessing impacts of land cover and land use change on freshwater fish habitat, and exploring data fusion approaches for representing wildlife habitat for bird and mammal species of conservation interests across large spatial extents.

Dr. Vogeler and her lab are also working on two Africa based projects integrating multi-resolution remote sensing data for the identification of urbanization-driven land cover land use change “hotspots” and their associated social and ecological implications across three countries (Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa) and investigations of the impacts of urbanization and rewilding on biodiversity in the Kruger National Park Region of South Africa.
