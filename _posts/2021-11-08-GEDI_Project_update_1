At the Vogeler lab, we are all about exploring new ways to visualize and use abstract scientific data. 

A relatively new NASA project, the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (aka GEDI) has been pushing the limits of science by providing freely available, full waveform spaceborn LiDAR data.

While this data is relatively young (GEDI started collecting data in 2019) few people have a solid grasp of what the data is, and what it looks like.

Part of investigating new data comes with the task of visualizing abstract data. Sure, tables and graphs are awesome, but what about something a bit more visually appealing?
