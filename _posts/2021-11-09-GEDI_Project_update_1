At the Vogeler lab, we are all about exploring new ways to leverage, model, and visualize remote sensing data. 

The NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (aka GEDI) is a recent NASA project using high resolution laser ranging observations of the 3D structure of the earth.

The data produced by the GEDI sensor contains a variety of different metrics, including elevation, canopy height profiles, percent forest cover, among others.

Part of investigating new data comes with the task of visualizing abstract data. Sure, tables and graphs are awesome, but what about something a bit more visually appealing? 

One of my recent efforts has been focused on visulazing GEDI spaceborne LiDAR data in three dimensional space. 

Starting from the top, here is an image representing the available GEDI data for our selected study states (Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Montana)
